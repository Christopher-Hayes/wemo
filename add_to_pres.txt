  - talk about how the switch operates using xml soap http requests through port 49152
    - get and set is done by getting an xml or sending an xml with the filled in data
    - /upnp/control/basicevent1
  - the netcam on the otherhand operates strictly with get and post requests on port 80 where the url decides what content is being set/get
