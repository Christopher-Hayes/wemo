# What is WeMo?
WeMo is a series of IoT devices produced by Belkin. The devices use PnP (Plug 'n Play) technology on IP networks to allow user to remotely control a device over the local network. Connecting to the devices involves connecting to the ad-hoc open wifi network transmitted by the device and facilitating the connection between the WeMo device and the local network.
# Purpose of this Project
- Learn about how WeMo devices function.
- Build a Python application to interact with these devices and provide visual feedback where applicable.
- Identify and investigate potential security vulnerbilities.
